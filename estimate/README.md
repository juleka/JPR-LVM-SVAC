In the **estimate task**, we compute several sets of latent variable estimates.

Note that we do not set a random seed. For this reason, the estimates, parameters and model fit statistics  vary slighty with each computation. 

For the main article, we compute one set of static and dynamic latent estimates  with  2,092 conflict-actor-year observation, respectively. For each respective set of estimates, we  compute the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) score,  plot the posterior draws for the scaled difficulty cut-points (alpha) (Figure 6 in the main article), and plot the Rhat statistic to examine model convergence (Figure 4 in the Online Appendix).
